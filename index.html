<h2>Radio Internship</h2>
<p>
    My radio career started out back in 2013.  Before i got started in radio i was delivering and cooking pizzas full time at a restaurant in Chesterfield called Rich & Charlies. I had just graduated from the Nelly Institute with a certificate in Recording Engineering & Producing.  I was on the lookout to find an internship that had anything to do with audio.  Luckily for me my boss at the time used to work with a guy who was now the executive producer at CBS Sports 920.  I was given the role as an intern with tasks such as answering phones, uploading the segments from that days show and interestingly enough subject matter in the code to show what was talked about during the shows.  The internship was only supposed to last 3 months but i found a way to stay on an extra month in order to apply for the board operator position. I eventually secured the position for one day a week for a two-hour shift but i was pumped because i was officially working in the audio industry now!

    <h2>On to a New Station</h2>
    <p>
        I worked as hard as i could taking every shift i could, and they finally gave me a stream of steady hours. It was the 5p-1a shift but that didn't matter to me.  I continued to work at that station for 2 years until i was hired on at a new station.  The new station that i worked for was 590 the fan. I would be doing the same thing i was doing(board operator for sports talk shows) at the old station but this time with fewer hours.  I was given a two-hour show to work for mon-fri but on top of being a board operator i was also now a producer.  Which wasn't really what i wanted to do but it was a new challenge so i gladly accepted.  I would always go to work super early to make sure that all the guests were lined up and that the subject matter for the days show was well organized and ready to go.  Fast forward a year ad oe day i was talking to our engineer about remote broadcasts.  He was also the head engineer at Emmis Communications who owned 105.7 The point Kshe 95 and a few other stations.  He asked me if i would be interested in doing remote broadcast for them on my day off and i happily obliged.  I ended up working for them for a few months until the news broke that their company was being sold to Hubbard Radio.  In my mind i would be starting all over again being a board operator and would be losing my second source of income.  Luckily for me i was part of the group that was transferred over to Hubbard and was given full time employment as a remote broadcast engineer/engineering assistant.

    <h2>Remote Broadcast Position</h2>
    <p>
        Finally, i was rewarded for my efforts and received a full time position with Hubbard radio as a remote broadcast engineer.  This position was very enjoyable as i got to do a lot of cool things and meet a lot of cool(sometimes mean) people.  The downside is that it was very stressful.  I dont mid stressful situations and honestly somewhat thrive in them but after a wile it starts to get tiresome.  The issue was that there was no second line of defense.  If you had a problem you couldn't call anyone for help because if you did you would just be calling yourself. I enjoyed the fast pace work environment because it always kept you on your toe.  Lots of problems arise and you have to be able to fix or find a backup resolution within a matter of seconds since it is live radio.  I would work that job for almost three years.  One day we were all called into the conference room for a staff meeting where we were told that 101 ESPN had just purchased the rights to the Blues Radio Broadcast. Which meant they were looking for some engineers to run the audio equipment at the games.

    <h2>Blues Broadcast Engineer</h2>
    <p>
        The day came where the Blues were asking for engineers for the games.  I was one of two who would be given the position.  The main guy who was my co-worker at the time would be given a majority of the games and i would be given the ones that he could not do.  Which was fine with me since i love watching Hockey live!  It was a very enjoyable job.  But this time the stakes were considerably higher than they were with just the standard remote broadcasts. I was given the opportunity to become the full time engineer for the radio broadcast but turned it down due to work/life balance and i was no longer feeling like radio was for me.  I loved it but there is a lot more that goes into it than just mixing sound during the broadcasts.  That was the fun part but everything in between which made up most of my job was the parts that i will not miss.  As that season was winding down the pandemic started...

    <h2>The Pandemic...</h2>
    <p>
        The day was March 1st 2020 and everything seemed to be normal.  There was talk about a virus but other that nothing big had happened until i got a call from my boss stating that i needed to work from home until told otherwise.  I got lucky because since i was a remote broadcast engineer and my job was on location their wasn't really anything for me to do.  So I essentially got a month long paid vacation minus a few errands I had to run for the station until I got the call on May 1st that I was being laid off.  It was a major blow even though I kind of expected that it was coming due to no live broadcasts for the foreseeable future.  After I was laid off and ended up working for DoorDash as a driver.  Then after a year of that I heard about the schooling opportunity with LaunchCode.  I had always had an interest learning about websites and how they worked but didn't really know where to start since it all looked so intimidating.  I ended up facing my fears and submitting an application to the program.  Luckily I was accepted and now here I am 6 weeks later and coding every day/night!  I am excited to see what the future has in store for me!
